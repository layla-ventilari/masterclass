# Rocketseat Masterclass: Server Components in Next.js 13

In this masterclass, we will learn about Server Components in Next.js 13, including how they differ from traditional React components and their benefits for web application development. We will also learn how to use Server Components to build a solid foundation and create high-performance web applications.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started with this masterclass, it is recommended that you have basic knowledge of React and Next.js.

## What are Server Components?
Server Components are a new feature in Next.js 13 that allow developers to split their application logic between the server and the client. They are similar to traditional React components, but with a few key differences.

Server Components are executed on the server-side, which means they can fetch data and perform other operations before the component is sent to the client. This can result in faster load times and improved performance for your application.

Another key difference is that Server Components can be lazily loaded, meaning they are only loaded when needed. This can help to reduce the initial load time of your application and improve the overall user experience.

## Benefits of Server Components
There are several benefits to using Server Components in your Next.js applications:

- Improved performance: Since Server Components are executed on the server-side, they can help to improve the overall performance of your application by reducing the load time and improving the user experience.

- Reduced complexity: Server Components allow you to split your application logic between the server and the client, making it easier to manage and maintain your codebase.

- Better SEO: Server Components can improve the SEO of your application by allowing search engines to crawl your content more easily.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this masterclass, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of Server Components and how they differ from traditional React components.
- Create Server Components in your Next.js applications.
- Utilize Server Components to improve the performance and SEO of your web applications.

## How to Get Started
To get started with this masterclass, you will need to have the latest version of Next.js (version 13) installed on your machine. You can install it using npm or yarn.

Once you have Next.js installed, you can clone the starter code for this masterclass from the Rocketseat Github repository.

## Conclusion
Server Components are a powerful new feature in Next.js 13 that can help you to create high-performance web applications with improved SEO. By utilizing Server Components in your Next.js applications, you can split your application logic between the server and the client, reducing complexity and improving overall performance.
